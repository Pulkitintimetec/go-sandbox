# Learning Go

This is just a sandbox repository for me to put in random programming, mostly for me to learn go. The motivation is that I want to learn a new backend language to be able to write high-performance backend services, and there are many projects (k8s, docker, normad) are written in go. If i understand Go it will be easier for me to understand these projects.


What i like about Go:

  * Clear and nice syntax.
  * Channel and goroutine is awesome, a lot more cleaner than in python where i have to use Condition for cordination.
  * Concurrency is easy to reason. Everything is blocking, unless you let it `go`.
  * Strong-typed
  * Fast compilation

What I don't like about Go:

  * Single workspace is a confusing.
  * Error handling is just awful. It's too bad that Go does not have a try / catch block.
  * JSON deserialization is hard if you deal with generic interface
  * You tend to write more code due to the verbose syntax of Go
  * Lacking of Generic (coming soon)

## I/O

  * [Use bytes.Buffer for string writer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13765797/the-best-way-to-get-a-string-from-a-writer-in-go)
  * Use strings.Reader for string reader

## Channels

Itâ€™s okie to leave channel open. GC will collect it

## Slices

  * [Use copy() to copy slice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30182538/why-can-not-i-duplicate-a-slice-with-copy-in-golang)
  * Use `[]byte(str)` to convert string to byte array.
  * Use `string(bytes)` to convert byte to string.
  * [Remove an item in slice](https://vbauerster.github.io/2017/04/removing-items-from-a-slice-while-iterating-in-go/)
